# GitHub's Additional Products and Features

I could go on forever about all the other stuff GitHub does and offers - but here are a few highlights:

## Extra features

### GitHub Copilot

Copilot - different to the Microsoft product of the same name - is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code.

> [!NOTE]  
> GitHub Copilot comes in three flavours - Individual, Business, and Enterprise.

### GitHub Actions

Actions are a way to automate your workflows in GitHub. You can build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want - to name just a few things!

### Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that you can use to develop your projects from within GitHub. It's a fully managed dev environment that you can access from anywhere, any time, and provides you with a VS Code-style editor and a range of powerful compute resources for your projects.

### Advanced Security

Advanced Security is a suite of security features that help you find, fix, and prevent security vulnerabilities in your code. It includes:

* Dependabot
* CodeQL
* Secret Scanning
* Code Scanning
* Security Advisories
* Dependency Reviews

> [!NOTE]
> GHAS is currently only available for Enterprise accounts. You can read more about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security).
